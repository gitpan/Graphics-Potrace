=head1 NAME

Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Importer - vectorial exporter base class for Graphics::Potrace

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0_03

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a base class for building up raster importers. One example
of using this base class is shipped directly in the distribution
as L<Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Ascii>.

You only need to override one of three methods: L</load_handle> or L</load_data>.

In this class these two methods are both defined in terms of the other,
so that you can really override only one of them and get the other one
for free.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 B<< clear_target >>

Clears the currently set target raster (see L</target>).

=head2 B<< has_target >>

Checks whether the object has a target bitmap for load operations or not.
See also L</target>.

=head2 B<< load_data >>

   my $bitmap = $importer->load_data($scalar);

Import data from a scalar variable. The format the data inside the
C<$scalar> depends on the particular derived class.

=head2 B<< load >>

   my $bitmap = $importer->load(data => $scalar);
   my $bitmap = $importer->load(file => $filename);
   my $bitmap = $importer->load(fh => $filehandle);

Import data from a scalar, a file or a filehandle. The format of the data
in the file/filehandle depends on the derived class. This method
leverages upon B</load_data> and L</load_handle>. In this way you can use
one single method and decide what you want to pass in exactly.

=head2 B<< load_handle >>

   my $bitmap = $importer->load_handle($filehandle);

Import data from a filehandle. This functionality is already covered
by L</load> above, but this method is more useful for overriding in
derived classes.

=head2 B<< new >>

   my $i = Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Importer->new(%args);

Constructor. The only common parameter that you can set is C<target>,
corresponding to set L</target>.

=head2 B<< target >>

   my $raster = $importer->target();
   $importer->target($raster);

Quasi-accessor for setting the target bitmap for the import. This is
a I<quasi>-accessor because if no target is currently defined (you can
check it with C</has_target>) then a new one will be provided each time
you call this method.
