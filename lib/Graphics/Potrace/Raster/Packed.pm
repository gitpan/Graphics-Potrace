=head1 NAME

Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Packed - importer of packed rasters for Graphics::Potrace

=head1 VERSION

version 0.73

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an importer for L<Graphics::Potrace>. It derives from
L<Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Importer>, so see it for generic methods.
In particular, this class overrides L</load_handle> in order to
provide means to load a raster image from a packed version of some
other raster image (see L<Graphics::Potrace::Raster/packed>).

=head1 INTERFACE

Only method L<Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Imported/load_data> is
supported (and C<load> whereas it calls C<load_data>). Attempts to
call L<Graphics::Potrace::Raster::Imported/load_handle> will fail.
